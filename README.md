# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

The challenge was an on-the-job ticket with starter code that you needed to be modified. This week's Challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility. The goal was to update the website to ensure it follows accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines. I updated the HTML and alt text to make it more accessable and the CSS to make sure it was perfoming properly. I learnt a lot about accessability and CSS classes.
